This is an RFID based localisation and navigational system for multiple mobile robots within a given environment

Localization is done for the workspace using the nodes with RFID tags and black strips of lines were used for assisting 
the navigation across the arena.
The robot basically consists of two controllers:ie primary  controller with a NodeMCU and a  secondary  controller with 
an Arduino Mega for motion control 	
Primary controller deals with the commands sending and receival with the CPS(Central Processing 
System) and secondary controller.In other terms it could be defined as the brain  of the system
Secondary controller deals with the basic motion across the grids.It consists of LSA 08 advanced line sensor and the MPU 6050 IMU which asssists its motion through the environment
Communication between primary and secondary controllers happens through serial communication.
Communication between primary controller and the CPS (Central Processing System) happens across MQTT.
